# Sketch Sir Explain-A-Lot

Hey World.

I'm Sir Explain-A-Lot, a small plugin for explaining your awesome Sketch Designs.



By pressing ctrl+shift+e this will happen:
- Sir Explain-A-Lot will create a rounded icon with an "?" in it on your current artboard
- Sir Explain-A-Lot will copy your current artboard with all content
- Sir Explain-A-Lot will create a new half-transparent layer on the copied artboard with an "X"-Icon and a example of an explaining comment


We use it for explaining a clickdummy:
Just hotspot the small "?"-icon on your screen to link to the explaining screen and hotspot the "X"-icon to get back to the previous screen.

This makes communication a lot easier and helps your customers and developers to understand your great design much easier.


Enjoy your personal experience with Sir Explain-A-Lot
It's an early version, don't judge me on any missing features.
