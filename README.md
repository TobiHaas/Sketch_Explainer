# Sketch Sir Explain-A-Lot

Hey World.

I'm Sir Explain-A-Lot, a small plugin for explaining your awesome Sketch Designs.

![alt tag](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/44855183/m-way/For%20Sketch%20Sir%20Explain-A-Lot/animation.gif)

By pressing Ctrl + Shift + E or by starting the Plugin through the menu bar this is going to happen:

- Sir Explain-A-Lot will create a rounded icon with an "?" in it on your current artboard
- Sir Explain-A-Lot will copy your current artboard with all contents
- Sir Explain-A-Lot will create a new half-transparent layer on the copied artboard with an "X"-Icon and a example of an explaining comment


We use it for explaining a clickdummy:
Just hotspot the small "?"-icon on your screen to link to the explaining screen and hotspot the "X"-icon to get back to the previous screen.

This makes communication a lot easier and helps your customers and developers to understand your great designs much easier.


Enjoy your personal experience with Sir Explain-A-Lot.

It's an early version, so please don't judge on any missing features.
